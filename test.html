              Hello, it is me, Matthias 'Pinny' Pinnewaert. A web developer
              always looking for challenges, trying to improve and create a
              better user experience. Born and raised in Belgium.
            </p>
            <p>
              Story mode: I discovered programming at the end of my bachelor
              degree in electronics and soon after started to learn HTML, css
              and js (using jquery). Tried to apply for a job with no success in
              the developer scene, after a while I found a job to program and
              operate an industrial robot. (the robot had to fold metal pieces)
              After learning the robot there was some dowmtime at the job which
              created the opportunity to create an environment to improve the
              workflow of the company. I created a platform for the employee's
              where they can look things up, change things, ... in a faster and
              user friendly environment than the ERP software had to offer. I
              had to start from scratch and had no idea on how or what to start.
              I started out trying out a bit of the most used frameworks and
              made the choice to use Vue.js, the biggest reason for me was the
              low entry curve. Later on this changed to the library Nuxt.js
              which speeded up the process of creating the environment by a lot.
              Now the project covers things from looking up to creating print
              layouts for parts and even converting 3D drawings to 2D CNC
              machine ready files. This project is now about 2 years of work in
              my down time at work (when the robot is working) and I’m very
              proud about it.

            <p>
              Other things I did in my spare time is learning the unreal engine
              in combination with C++ (created a chess game and started some
              other projects). Also started drawing a bit of pixel art. I also
              game, watch series and make a bit of music (electronic drum &
              bass).

                This project is my main job at work and is still in development,
                it is also my first project in Vue and my first full-stack
                project. It uses the ERP database (and some other databases) to
                visualise data for the employees, it’s a more user friendly
                environment which allows the user to look-up things faster. As
                time went by it grew a bit bigger. It includes a new system that
                replaces the old excel files that contained the part information
                and drawings. It also replaced a program that created ‘nestings’
                of multiple parts for the laser (because of the new ERP program)
                and it also replaced the old badge system that all the employees
                have to use now when they do an operation of an order.

                  Before starting this project I had only experience in html and
                  jquery. So I can’t remember all the decisions but I’ll try to
                  explain the things I remember. *Why use javascript and not use
                  any other languages to write software? - At the time I really
                  wanted to learn web development so js was an easy choice it
                  was also the most flexible and the easiest to deploy and
                  maintain (new version, update server and done, software is
                  local so update on everyone's pc seemed a lot of work and at
                  the time I had no idea how I could create an automatic update
                  system) *Why use Vue.js? -With me having no experience and
                  having to convince my boss I could create something in a short
                  time period I quickly tested out the 3 biggest frameworks (at
                  the time Vue was an upcoming one, but had a lot of promise if
                  I believed my friend). The result of the test was that Vue
                  felt the easiest and cleanest to use. (And I don’t regret that
                  choice!) *Why Nuxt.js? - I still had no experience in
                  developing anything and because there was a bit of pressure in
                  the time window I had to prove myself I could do this. And
                  found a boilerplate with nuxt and express back-end in one
                  project. These were the 3 starting choices I had to make now
                  I’ll try to pick stuff that was interesting to me breaking up
                  the project in tiny parts. The deployment of the project The
                  first deployment we used was via an linux server and using
                  docker containers to deploy the project via nginx but because
                  we wanted to use the filesystem of the company this was not
                  possible via linux so we had to use an ftp server to upload
                  files to the correct folder. But after a while we changed to a
                  windows server so we didn’t need the fpt server anymore and to
                  deploy it we used the nodeiis module to run it via iis And now
                  via git I can just push it and build it on the server with a
                  few clicks. The next big thing was the use of Electron.js A
                  problem I could not fix was the ability to open files from the
                  server because of browser security; this was not possible but
                  then I discovered Electron.js. This way it was possible to
                  open files with the correct server path. But one problem again
                  was the maintenance of an app. At the time I just rendered the
                  website in an electron environment and only used it to open
                  files so there were no updates to be done. Later on I added
                  more and more stuff like tabs so you can open multiple
                  instances of the site in the app and in the latest update I
                  made it so the app can be automatically updated by the user so
                  no more manual installs, yay TL;DR The update system uses the
                  electron-update package and looks at a static server where you
                  can put the installer and a yml script created when you build
                  the app For the static server I just use an IIS service on a
                  windows server and allow it to see the files in the folder,
                  now I just build it on the server and copy the files to the
                  static folder and when they restart the app they will be asked
                  to install the update. An order: In this picture you see an
                  example of an order, this is probably the most used feature.
                  It contains everything you need to see as an employee. The
                  view shows information you need at least a few clicks if you
                  want the same in the ERP software in addition the format and
                  thumbnail of the part comes from a custom database that is
                  used to create a ‘nesting’ to laser the parts (mode
                  explanation will come later about this). It also allows you to
                  open/add/delete files connected to the part, close operations
                  (if an employee forgot to badge) and open the order or part in
                  the ERP software (orange buttons)
