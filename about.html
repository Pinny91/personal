              Hello, it is me, Matthias 'Pinny' Pinnewaert. A web developer
              always looking for challenges, trying to improve and create a
              better user experience. Born and raised in Belgium.
            </p>
            <p>
              Story mode: I discovered programming at the end of my bachelor
              degree in electronics and soon after started to learn HTML, css
              and js (using jquery). Tried to apply for a job with no success in
              the developer scene, after a while I found a job to program and
              operate an industrial robot. (the robot had to fold metal pieces)
              After learning the robot there was some dowmtime at the job which
              created the opportunity to create an environment to improve the
              workflow of the company. I created a platform for the employee's
              where they can look things up, change things, ... in a faster and
              user friendly environment than the ERP software had to offer. I
              had to start from scratch and had no idea on how or what to start.
              I started out trying out a bit of the most used frameworks and
              made the choice to use Vue.js, the biggest reason for me was the
              low entry curve. Later on this changed to the library Nuxt.js
              which speeded up the process of creating the environment by a lot.
              Now the project covers things from looking up to creating print
              layouts for parts and even converting 3D drawings to 2D CNC
              machine ready files. This project is now about 2 years of work in
              my down time at work (when the robot is working) and Iâ€™m very
              proud about it.

              .
            </p>
            <p>
              Other things I did in my spare time is learning the unreal engine
              in combination with C++ (created a chess game and started some
              other projects). Also started drawing a bit of pixel art. I also
              game, watch series and make a bit of music (electronic drum &
              bass).
